# Calculator

More Kotlin-Android fun!

Instructions: Create a calculator that can perform 5 operations:
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and find the
remainder (modulus). The calculator should only be able to
work with 2 real numbers. You will need to display the operation
that is currently selected, as well as display a solution and
find a way to clear your result and start over. If you have
extra time, keep and display a history of all operations done.

Implementation includes:
* Recycler View
* Low level unit tests
* Instrumented tests with espresso



TODO
* Make the list items deletable
* Enhance design with MVP or MVVM
* Additional instrumented tests
* Store the history in sqlLiteDb
